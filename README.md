# Python-Jump-and-Run-Game
A very simple Jump and Run game made in python with pygame
## What is this?
I always wanted to create a simple Jump and Run game, but I never really had time to do it. So today was the day! I sat down for half an hour and created this simple game. Download the code, run the little game and that's it! If you want to enrich it with some features, just do it!
## How does it work?
This game was created using python and pygame. You can jump with the space bar. Don't hit the green rectangle or the game is over! Have fun!
